# Contributing to pages
We are glad you want to make a contribution.

Fork this repository and send in a pull request when you are finished with your changes. Link any relevant issues in too.

Before you create a pull request, please review the following points:
* No pep8 errors/warning are introduced - run flake8 to find out.
* Unit test coverage should never go down - if unsure on how to add/change existing unit tests, reach out for help.
* New additions need explanations in details. Update README, have it proof-read and add usage examples under the sample folder.
* Changes to the existing repo should keep the existing styling conventions: the whole code should read as if it was written by the same author.

# Issues
* File the issue and take note of the issue number. 
* Create a pull request containing a test failing because of the issue you are reporting. Place your test under the samples folder and name it after your issue: e.g. test_issue_5.py.
